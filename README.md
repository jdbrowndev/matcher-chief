# matcher-chief

This C# solution contains a fan-inspired Halo matchmaking server and client using ASP.NET Core and Web Sockets. It is 100% fan-inspired and does not interface with a Halo client in any way, instead serving as a study on video game matchmaking algorithms.

# Run

Run the server:
```
cd src/MatcherChief.Server
dotnet run
```

Run simulated clients:
```
cd tools/MatcherChief.ClientRunner
dotnet run
```
